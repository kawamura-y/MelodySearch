ABOUT THE MUSIC:
Here is Scott Joplin's beautiful "Solace - A Mexican Serenade", 
written in 1909.

Rudi Blesh, writing in "Scott Joplin - The Complete Piano Works", 
exclaims that the six piano compositions that Joplin published in 
1909 would assure him a high place in American Music, were those 
all that he had ever written.

Marvin Hamlisch selected "Solace" as one of the Joplin pieces 
featured in the motion picture "The Sting", although, for a reason 
which escapes me, he chose only the C and D strains from the piece 
to use in the sound track.  Because of this, many prople do not 
recognize the piece until they hear the C strain.  Incidentally, 
it's the C strain which you hear in my sound clip.

This piece is the only one Joplin wrote in the tango rhythm. Blesh 
writes-"Originally from Cuba, by way of African cult houses where 
it is said to have been known by its African tribal name, 'Tangana', 
this rhythm had entered American piano literature as early as 1860 
with Louis Moreau Gottschalk's 'Souvenir de la Havane'. The first 
reported instance of tango in the unchronicled history of American 
Negro music is a rag-tango called 'The Dream', composed and played 
by an itinerant black player, Jessie Pickett, at the Chicago World's 
Fair in 1893."

ABOUT THE PERFORMER:
My name is John Roache.  I am an amateur ragtime enthusiast living 
in Torrance California.  I have been playing piano and keyboards for 
almost 50 years.  I began creating ragtime computer music in the mid-
'80s on the Commodore-64 using the SIDPLAYER music composition
program.  In 1994, I discovered the power of MIDI and have been
sequencing ragtime, stride and swing music since then.

In the fall of 1997 I recorded and released my first CD of Ragtime, 
Stride and Novelty Piano music titled "Syncopated Odyssey".  It has
received positive reviews from the critics.  Complete information
about the CD can be found on my WWW site.

I would be pleased to hear any of your comments about this midi.
