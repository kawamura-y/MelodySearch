Here is "Bethena, A Concert Waltz" by Scott Joplin published in 1905.

ABOUT THE MIDI FILES:
There are 2 MIDI files in this archive:

BTHENA_S.MID is a stereo midi which uses pan controller instructions to
place each note in a stereo spectrum.  Lowest note at the far left and
the highest note far right.  All the rest somewhere in between depending
on their pitch.  It sounds just like you were sitting in front of a
player piano.

BTHENA_M.MID is the same performance with all the pan controller in- 
structions removed.  I discovered that some FM synthesis sound cards
(such as the ProAudio Spectrum and SoundBlaster)
cannot handle pan controller calls correctly.  Most of the notes play
in the center of the two channels with an occasional high note playing
far right and a few low notes playing far left.  This is very unnatural
sounding and if your sound card is this type, use this file which will
play OK.

This MIDI was sequenced with Cakewalk Pro on a SB AWE 32
sound card.  Your sound card may not reproduce bass notes with the
same intensity as the AWE.  If this is the case, the balance between
the Right Hand part (Track 1) and the Left Hand part (track 2) will
need to be adjusted.  Load the file into a sequencer and edit the 
track volumes according to your taste and sound card.

ABOUT THE COMPOSER AND THE COMPOSITION:
Scott Joplin, the "King of Ragtime Composers", in 1904 was near the peak 
of his career when his young bride, Freddie Alexander of Little Rock, Arkansas
died just 2 months after their marriage.  The existance of Freddie was almost
forgotten.  None of Joplin's acquaintances who had been interviewed for
eariler biographies had ever referred to her.  Edward A. Berlin in his 
recently published Joplin biography, "King of Ragtime" devotes an entire 
chapter to Freddie.  His meticulous research proves her existence and brings 
to light several facts about her. I quote: "It is strange that none of Joplin's
associates who were interviewed in later years, including his widow Lottie and
his friends Arthur Marshall and Sam Patterson, mentioned Freddie.  Perhaps the
brevity of the marriage made it insignificant in the minds of his friends.
But Freddie was not insignificant to Joplin, for some years later he was
to memorialize her in his most ambitious work [his opera "Treemonisha"]".

"Bethena" was the first Joplin work published after the death of Freddie.
The piece was dedicated to Mr. & Mrs. Dan Davenport.  I again quote Berlin;
"This is an unusual dedication.  Davenport was not a prominent performer
who could showcase Joplin's music.  Nor was he a person of influence or
wealth, one who could have helped Joplin's career or commissioned music.
So why should Joplin dedicate this piece to Davenport or his wife?"

"The dedication may have had personal significance.  Since this is Joplin's
first copyrighted work (March 6, 1905) since Freddie's death.  I think the
Davenports might have helped Joplin through some difficult times, and the
dedication was his way of showing appreciation.  Supporting the idea that
"Bethena" is connected with Freddie, or at least reflects Joplin's mood at
the time, is that the music is sadly poignant.  It is decidedly not a
cheerful, merry waltz, and in this respect contrasts with all of Joplin's
other waltzes."

"But then, what is the significance of the title?  "Bethena" is an unusual
name.  Was there a Bethena?  If so, is she the beautiful woman pictured on
the cover?  Or (and this is highly speculative) is this a picture of
Freddie."  Since Freddie was her given name, could Bethena be her nickname?
All speculation aside, Bethena is an enchanting piece and is amoung the
greatest of ragtime waltzes.

ABOUT THE PERFORMER:
My name is John Roache.  I am an amateur ragtime enthusiast living 
in Torrance California.  I have been playing piano and keyboards for 
almost 50 years.  I began creating ragtime computer music in the mid-
'80s on the Commodore-64 using the SIDPLAYER music composition
program.  In 1994, I discovered the power of MIDI and have been
sequencing ragtime, stride and swing music since then.

I would be pleased to hear any of your comments about this midi.
